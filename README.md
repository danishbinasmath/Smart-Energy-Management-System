<h1>Title: Smart Energy Management System</h1>

Description: The project aims to develop a web-based platform that uses AI/ML algorithms to optimize energy consumption in homes and buildings. The platform will collect energy usage data from connected devices, analyze it using AI/ML algorithms, and provide recommendations to users on how to reduce energy consumption and costs.

<h2>Features:</h2>

User registration and login system
Dashboard displaying real-time energy usage data and recommendations for energy savings
Integration with smart home devices to collect energy usage data
Machine learning models to analyze energy usage patterns and provide recommendations for energy savings
User-controlled settings for customized energy-saving goals and preferences
Notifications to alert users when energy usage is high and provide suggestions for reducing consumption
Integration with energy providers to provide cost-saving recommendations based on electricity pricing plans
Admin panel for managing users and devices

<h2>Technologies:</h2>

Web development: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS
Backend development: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB
AI/ML: Python, TensorFlow, Keras
Potential Impact: By optimizing energy consumption in homes and buildings, the platform could contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting sustainable energy practices. The project could also help reduce energy costs for users and promote a more sustainable and cost-effective energy system.
